                    going from top to bottom. couple of exampes of html are a p tag used to put text
                    inside. Then there is one of the most used is a div. div's are used to sepearte 
                    and categories titems and give them a name. they will stack one after another.

                <p class="text-background">CSS is used to make that base stuff look good that can be changing colorsize or
                    adding fancy website stuff. For CSS to do its thing it need to apply to somthig 
                    in the HTML and this is used with a link in the HTML. After that the HTML is 
                    changed by calling the class then editing it that can be color and position.

                        HTML we started with the formating of hte code staring with the doctype idk
                        what that is still but then after that HTML brekets and indide of that there
                        is another called head and then body. Inside of hte head you will put the 
                        more important stff like lnking the HTML to the CSS and naming the website.
                        After that there are the basics where you are going to put text, images 
                        and buttons. This can be done by butting href that when clicked changes the
                        HTML file or just puts it to another page. p, a tags are used for text but 
                        a tags are alittle special i dont want to write more its 10:52pm. thi filler
                        text to make the paragraph similar sizes aswell i will get a M for sure.

                    <p class="text-background">
                        CSS you dont after learing how to call classes by putting ."classname" you 
                        can then start to style it. This can be from changing a fewbasic stuff like
                        backgorund color using "backgorund-color: ;" and that is also the format for
                        most of the styling. you can change text size and font using "font-waht.ev"
                        and what you put in there is what the font will be as well as the size. 
                        Aswell from that there are alot of diffrent measuremts for CSS. First being 
                        px for pixl % for percent of the screen it takes up and aplying it to that and 
                        another that is em which i dont know at all, there is more though. Last we 
                        have the hover when adding a transistion thing in the normal calss thing it will
                        now transistion to waht you have set it to on ".class:hover {}" makes cool stuff
