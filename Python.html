        <h1 class="Gintro"><u>Welcome to the Python Section</u></h1>

        <div class="Gsection-1">
            <p>Python is a coding languages that has 3 main purposes one making website to make them
                have more advanced animations and process. Two to deal with data compile and then 
                display. Three is for task automation or macros. For this school task we will be making
                a quizz uning Python and that is compiling and processing information after it asks 
                questions and summerising the score of the user.

            <div class="PythonBasics">
                <p>Varibles are the things that hold information in code there are generlly 3 types.
                    There are Interger varibles that hold numbers. There is String varibles that hold 
                    text informaion and last there is boolean operators that are one of 2 thing true 
                    or false. There are also 3 other's but me lazy :]

                <p>This is an "if" statement they will do somthing if somthing is somthing in this if a 
                    varible called studied-subject is one a interger it will do what is inside if it is
                    one aka true pretty self expainatory. In case you havent relised yet this is code from
                    my assignment.

                <p>Print statement are used to debug in games or help the coder understand what is wrong 
                    with their code but in this case it is used to reply to what you do in the console aswell
                    as the if statement it is self expainatory as it will print what is inside of the brakets 
                    into the console.
                </p>

                <img src="Reasourses/prints.png" width="270px" height="160px">
                <p>Last is somthing I like alot used for my favorite piece of code or proud of. This
                    is for statement's they will work as a loop as they will repeat a ammount of time's as 
                    there is somthing inside of what it is looking into, ignore the middle part and look at
                    the top it will look for as many thing in that list.

                <p>This assessment was to make a code for a quizz using Python i decided on makeing
                    two diffrent subjects math and digi tech. aswell as making this we had to document
                    the process of making it and test test and test. We would write these down and then 
                    fix the problem if thre was any. I had fun making the code but i am not so good at 
                    documenting so i got an achived.
                    <br><br><br><br><br>
                    One part of the code i am vary proud of seen in the image next to the text this code 
                    was made to check the spelling of an answer and look for key words. First it breaks 
                    the answer in to words by doing a for x in the answer then if it is a letter adds it 
                    to a varible. Then when there is a spcae it puts all the other latters into a word and
                    put in a list to then compare if that word is seen in the words that are part of the 
                    correct answer.
